SEIFitness App


Our app is mobile friendly first. The welcome page displays an introduction to the app before a user logs in to view the library of workouts. 


Next, a user can choose from the available workouts or open the menu and create their own. 


When a user chooses an existing workout they are directed to a page which displays directions for the workout including sets, reps, weights and equipment.


If a user chooses to create their own workout, they can determine directions for the workout including sets, reps, weights and equipment.


A user has the ability to change or remove their own workouts.
