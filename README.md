SEIFitness App

User begins by logging into the app. From there, they are able to view exercise (index) from our fitness databse. They can create a workout session (new, create), adding, editing, and deleting exercises in their session (show, edit, delete).

Exercises in the database will have type attributes (Schema), allowing them to be seperated or organized select exercises. They can even rate an exercises and view ratings, completed reps and sets, among other details (embedded schema).

While a user will have acccess to the database of exercises and exercise ratings, only by authenication/authorized user can they create sessions, edit their history, and attach reviews.
