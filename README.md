SEIFitness App
User views list of exercises (index) and can select which ones to perform (show). The user can add exercises to the db (new, create), delete exercises from their chosen set(delete) and edit existing exercises (edit, update). The exercises will have a type attribute (Schema) and users can navigate to a page specific to that attribute from the navbar. From the show page selection of exercises, the user will be able to indicate when they've completed exercises and provide a rating, reps, and other details (embedded schema). User can view the entire app as an authenticated/authorized user to see their specific history or without a log-in to view without attached history or exercise reviews.
